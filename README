This project aims to re-analyze experiments/studies with a fresh perspective, new data, and new methods. 
Often people will publish on data with a specific purpose, but what if there is another way to ask key questions or what if things were overlooked? Additionally, studies using studies like functional gene data may benefit from new information from databases, etc.

Idea 1: start with my own thesis. I've always wanted to go back and see if there was additional signal in the miRNA dataset. THere may have been some easy signal there that was unaccounted for due to the alignment, annotation or counting scheme. 

Idea 2: cross-reference the microbiome-disease project and re-analyze data that may be ~5-10 years old... where new information may lead to some new insights.
